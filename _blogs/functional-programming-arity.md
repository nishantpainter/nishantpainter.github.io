# Arity

The number of parameters a function consumes is called as the Arity of that function. 

The arity of the add function below is two since it uses two parameters.

```
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

A function that accepts single parameter is `unary`, the one that accepts two parameters is `binary`, three is `ternary` and `n` paramters is `n-ary`.
