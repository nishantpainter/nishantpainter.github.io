In recent years, Android has been a globally anticipated open source operating system for Smartphones. However, rapid advancement of Android is marred with augmenting threats of Android malwares that perform pernicious activities on Smartphones. Malwares exercising different techniques to dodge existing detection methods offer uncommon challenges for their accurate detection. Signature-based detection approach and machine-learning-based detection approach are the broad classifications for existing Android malware detection techniques. Researchers and antimalware companies have identified the inefficiency of signature-based detection approach and shifted to machine-learning-based detection approach to overcome the limitations of signature-based detection approach. This paper disserts existing machine-learning-based Android malware detection techniques and presents parametric comparison of discussed malware detection techniques. Hence, this paper targets to study various machine-learning-based detection techniques and to establish probable future directions."})}),(0,a.jsx)(h,{title:"Comparative Analysis of Android Malware Detection Techniques",img:"/img/springer-proceedings-of-the-international-conference-on-data-engineering-and-communication-technology.jpg",alt:"Information and Communication Technology for Sustainable Development",href:"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-10-1678-3",children:(0,a.jsx)(c.Z,{children:"In recent years, the widespread adoption of smartphones has led to a new age of information exchange.
